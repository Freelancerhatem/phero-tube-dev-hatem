                <li>It is also returned when trying to access an object property or array element that does not exist.</li>

                <li>It is often assigned to variables or properties to represent the intentional absence of a value.</li>

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold">Discuss about <span class="text-orange-400">Rest API</span> </h1>
               <ul class="list-disc pl-4">
                   
                <li>Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any information from previous requests. This statelessness simplifies server-side logic and makes the API more scalable.</li>

                <li>Resource-Based: In a REST API, resources are the key abstractions, and each resource is uniquely identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Resources can represent entities like users, products, or any other data object. For example, /users might represent a collection of user resources, and /users/123 might represent a specific user with the ID 123.</li>
                
                <li>HTTP Methods: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. The commonly used HTTP methods include:
                
                <span class="text-orange-400">GET:</span> Retrieve a resource or a collection of resources.
                <span class="text-orange-400">POST:</span> Create a new resource.
                <span class="text-orange-400">PUT:</span> Update an existing resource or create a resource if it doesn't exist.
                <span class="text-orange-400">PATCH:</span> Partially update an existing resource.
                <span class="text-orange-400">DELETE:</span> Remove a resource.
                <span class="text-orange-400">Uniform Interface:</span> REST APIs have a uniform and consistent interface, meaning that they use a consistent naming convention for resources and HTTP methods. This simplifies API design and makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API.</li>
                
                <li>Stateless Communication: Each client request to the server should include all the necessary information, and the server should not store any client state between requests. Any session state should be managed on the client side, if needed.</li>
                
                <li>Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, HTML, or others. Clients can specify their preferred representation using the Accept header in the request, and the server should respond with the requested representation.</li>
                
                <li>Layered System: REST APIs can be designed as a layered system, where each layer has a specific responsibility. This allows for flexibility and scalability by adding or removing layers as needed.</li>
                
                <li>Statelessness: REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any information from previous requests. This statelessness simplifies server-side logic and makes the API more scalable.</li>
